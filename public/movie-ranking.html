    <h2>Spider-Man Far From Home</h2>
    <p>Great movie. Amazing story telling and loved seeing Tobey and Andrew (sorry spoiler alert)</p>
    <br/>
    <h2>Avengers Infinity War</h2>
    <p>It was telling a story of Thanos he was more of an anti-hero as oppose to a villian and his point of view of why he did what he did</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Captain America Winter Soldier</h2>
    <p>A dark movie about captain america and working for a organization that turned out not to be what he thought had the same common goal.</p>
